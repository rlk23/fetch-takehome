This software was built using machine learning algorithm to predict the receipt in 2022 using the receipt in 2021.

You would need to run the files in the same directory. Everything should good to go as soon as you run. For docker part you would need to run these command lines I am going to provide.


Make sure you are in the right directory and run this 
 docker build -t getting-started .

 then run this 
 docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 getting-started
